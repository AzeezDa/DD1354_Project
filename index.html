            <h3>Update 0 - In Unity There Is Strength</h3>
            <h6>25th of February 2022</h6>

            <p>
                Welcome to my project blog in the DD1354 Models and Simulation course. My name is Azeez Daoud and I
                am here to invite you to venture with me in world of <b>WAVES!</b>. It is a world full of
                differential equations, numerical analysis, and a whole lot of springs and masses. Together we will
                build a system of coupled springs and masses, shake it (<b>A LOT!</b>) to produce two
                types of waves: transverse and longitudinal waves. The former propagates through the medium by
                displacing it perpendicularly in the direction of its motion. The latter displaces the medium in the
                direction of motion. This might seem quite abstract, so here is an image showing the two types:
            </p>

            <p>

                How do we visualise that? Well, we need 3 ingredients:
            <ol>
                <li>Physics</li>
                <li>Numerical Analysis</li>
                <li>Somewhere to do the simulation</li>
            </ol>

            Let us focus on the third point first by choosing a tool to do our simulation. I have decided to use <a
                href="https://unity.com/">The Unity Game Engine</a>, because it is easy set up and use. The medium
            we are going to make waves propagate through will be a rope-like object modelled as a chain of springs
            and masses, like in the following figure.
            </p>


            <figure class="center bordered">

                    alt="An image of transverse and longitudinal waves moving through a spring">
                <figcaption>

                    <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Coupled_Harmonic_Oscillator_k.svg/640px-Coupled_Harmonic_Oscillator_k.svg.png"

            <p>

                This is called a coupled spring-mass system which I will abbreviate as <abbr
                    title="Coupled Spring-Mass System">CSMS</abbr>, but more on that later. First we need to set up a
                few things in Unity:

            <ol>
                <li>Springs</li>
                <li>Masses</li>
                <li>Walls</li>
            </ol>

            Masses and walls are fairly easy to set up. Masses will be just an cube with coordinates for position and
            velocity (we can actually omit the mass for a reason that will become clear soon). And walls will also be a
            cube stretched and compressed to look like plane. We will also create a point on that wall where we can
            attach things to it. The most difficult of the three is springs, because they can stretch and compress. How
            should we achieve that in Unity? Simply we will attach a script to a cylinder that stores two coordinates
            (Transforms in Unity-lingo) it can attach to. Based on the vector between those objects we will stretch,
            move and orient
            that cylinder based on that vector. In the inspector it looks like this
            </p>

            </figure>

            <p>
                Let's add a couple of cube that move up and down and attach their Transforms to the spring to test that
                our stretchiness works.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>IT WORKS!</b> What next? Well let us set up a scene where we can do our little experiment. Just
                two walls, a floor and some light adjustments should work (we'll maybe make more
                beautiful later on).

            In the next update we will get our hands dirty with some physics and numerical integrators!
