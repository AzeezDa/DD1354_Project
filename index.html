            <h3>Update 0 - In Unity There Is Strength</h3>
            <h6>25th of February 2024</h6>

            <p>
                Welcome to my project blog in the DD1354 Models and Simulation course. My name is Azeez Daoud and I
                am here to invite you to venture with me in world of <b>WAVES!</b>. There we will encounter
                differential equations, numerical analysis, and a whole lot of springs and masses. Together we will
                build a system of coupled springs and masses, shake it (<b>A LOT!</b>) to produce two
                types of waves: transverse and longitudinal waves. The former propagates through the medium by
                displacing it perpendicularly in the direction of its motion. The latter displaces the medium in the
                direction of motion. This might seem quite abstract, so here is a figure showing the two types:
            </p>

                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>

                How do we visualise that? Well, we need 3 ingredients:
            <ol>
                <li>Physics</li>
                <li>Numerical Analysis</li>
                <li>Somewhere to do the simulation</li>
            </ol>

            Let us focus on the third point first by choosing a tool to do our simulation. I have decided to use <a
                href="https://unity.com/">The Unity Game Engine</a>, because it is easy set up and use. The medium
            we are going to make waves propagate through will be a rope-like object modelled as a chain of springs
            and masses, like in the following figure.
            </p>


            <figure class="center bordered">
                <img src="Blog/Update0/coupled_spring_mass.png"
                    alt="An image of transverse and longitudinal waves moving through a spring">
                <figcaption>
                    A coupled spring-mass system. Image from
                    <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/70/Coupled_Harmonic_Oscillator_k.svg/640px-Coupled_Harmonic_Oscillator_k.svg.png"
                        target="_blank">wikimedia.org</a>.
                </figcaption>
            </figure>


            <p>

                This is called a coupled spring-mass system which we will abbreviate as <abbr
                    title="Coupled Spring-Mass System">CSMS</abbr>, but more on that later. First we need to set up a
                few things in Unity:

            <ol>
                <li>Springs</li>
                <li>Masses</li>
                <li>Walls</li>
            </ol>

            Masses and walls are fairly easy to set up. Masses will be just an cube with coordinates for position and
            velocity (we can actually omit the mass for a reason that will become clear soon). Walls will also be a
            cube stretched and compressed to look like plane. We will also create a point on that wall where we can
            attach things to it. The most difficult of the three is springs, because they can stretch and compress. How
            should we achieve that in Unity? Simply we will attach a script to a cylinder that stores two coordinates
            (Transforms in Unity-lingo) it can attach to. Based on the vector between those objects we will stretch,
            move and orient that cylinder based on that vector. In the inspector it looks like this
            </p>

            </figure>

            <p>
                Let's add a couple of cube that move up and down and attach their Transforms to the spring to test that
                our stretchiness works.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>IT WORKS!</b> What next? Well let us set up a scene where we can do our little experiment. Just
                two walls, a floor and some light adjustments should work (we'll maybe make it more
                beautiful later on).

            Alright the stage is set! In the next update we will get our hands dirty with some physics and numerical
            integrators!

            <h3>Update 1 - Let There Be Waves</h3>
            <h6>26th of February 2024</h6>

            <p>
                Welcome back! Today's update will be filled with mathematics and physics but the results will hopefully
                be
                satisfying! Let us begin by creating a <abbr title="Coupled Spring-Mass System">CSMS</abbr>. We create
                an object which we will use to generate the CSMS and handle the physics for it. We give it the number of
                masses and it subdivides the vector between the walls into small parts in which we will place masses.
                Between two masses (or wall and mass) we put a spring whose connection points are the masses. The
                results
                look like this:
            </p>
            <figure class="center bordered">
                <img src="Blog/Update1/csms_generated.png" alt="An image of the unity">
                <figcaption>
                    The CSMS generated in the Unity Editor
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                Alright, now it is time to add some forces on this CSMS. Take any mass at coordinates given by \(X_i =
                (x_i, y_i, z_i)^T\) and with mass \(m\) (to avoid confusion I will use 'mass' for the physical property,
                and 'body' for the object that is a <em>mass</em>) in the system it will experience a number of forces:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <b>Gravitational Force</b>, given as \(F = -mg\hat{y}\) where \(\hat{y} = (0, 1, 0)^T\), or in other
                    words
                    a force pointing downwards (in Unity The y-axis in the up-down axis, so we will use that convention
                    here too), which is equal to the mass of the object times the gravitational acceleration which on
                    Earth is \(g \approx 9.81 ms^{-2}\).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Spring Forces</b>, given by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hooke%27s_law">Hooke's Law</a>
                    as \(F_\text{spring} = -k\left[(\lVert\Delta X_{i, i-1}\rVert - R)\frac{\Delta X_{i,
                    i-1}}{\lVert\Delta X_{i, i-1}\rVert} + (\lVert\Delta X_{i, i+1}\rVert - R)\frac{\Delta X_{i,
                    i+1}}{\lVert\Delta X_{i, i+1}\rVert}\right]\), where \(\Delta X_{i,j} = X_i - X_j\), \(k\) is the
                    spring constant and \(R\) is the rest length of the spring. The expression is combined the spring
                    forces from the springs from both sides of the body. From now on we will reduce the large expression
                    inside the square brackets to just \(\Delta X_i\).
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Damping Forces</b>, given as \(F_\text{damping} = -\gamma \dot{X}_i\), where \(\gamma\) is the
                    damping factor and \(\dot{X}_i\) is the velocity (first derivative with respect to time) of the
                    body.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Driving Force</b>, given as \(F_\text{driving} = F_0\cos(\omega_d t)\hat{y}\), which is
                    essentially a force that is given by a sinusoidal oscillation with amplitude \(F_0\) and angular
                    frequency \(\omega_d\). For now the driving force is in the \(\hat{y}\)-direction. We can actually
                    add this in different directions by making \(F_0\) a vector of amplitudes and multiplying by
                    different cosine functions with different frequencies, and even phases in each axis. We will do
                    that later on.
                </li>
            </ul>

            How do we combine all these forces? The answer is <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion?#Second_law">Newton's Second Law of
                Motion</a>:

            \[F_\text{total} = m\ddot{X}_i\]

            or in other words: the total force on a body is equal to its mass times its acceleration. So, what we get is
            the following:
            \begin{align*}
            F_\text{total} &= F_\text{gravity} + F_\text{spring} + F_\text{damping} + F_\text{driving} = \\
            m\ddot{X}_i &= -mg\hat{y} -k\Delta X_i - \gamma\dot{X}_i + F_0\cos(\omega_d t)\hat{y}= \\
            \ddot{X}_i &= -g\hat{y} - \frac{k}{m}\Delta X_i - \frac{\gamma}{m}\dot{X}_i + \frac{F_0}{m}\cos(\omega_d
            t)\hat{y}
            \end{align*}

            If we make each body have the same mass then we can forget about the mass and give the parameters to the
            simulation as values <em>normalised</em> by the mass. So the equation reduces to:

            \[
            \ddot{X}_i = -g\hat{y} - \omega^2\Delta X_i - \Gamma\dot{X}_i + \Lambda\cos(\omega_d t)\hat{y}
            \]

            (the reason the factor in front of \(\Delta X_i\) is \(\omega^2\) is due to solving the equation of motion
            of the harmonic oscillator analytically and getting \(\omega = \sqrt{\frac{k}{m}}\) as the natural frequency
            in the solution, so we will use that here too)
            </p>

            <p>
                'Alright, alright,' you may say. 'A non-homogenous second order differential equation‽ How will we solve
                that?' Good question! We must delve in the world of Numerical Analysis and ask for the assistance of the
                numerical integrators. We could use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_method">Euler's Forward
                    Method</a> but that is not stable enough (yes, it sends everything to everywhere in seconds). How
                about the famous Runge-Kutta methods? And more specifically, Runge-Kutta 4? Yes, that works! I won't go
                to the details of how the Runge-Kutta methods works, so I refer to the <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta_methods">Wikipedia page</a> and the book
                <em>Numerical Analysis</em> by Timothy Sauer.
            </p>

            <p>
                So, we start with that static CSMS, and for every body we do a single Runge-Kutta 4 iteration once each
                update (FixedUpdate in Unity with fixedDeltaTime set to 0.005s in order to make the calculations easy
                (fixed increments) and stable (small increments)). We do, however, only add the driving force
                \(F_\text{driving}\) so the first (leftmost) body, and we will see how the wave propagates. Let us see
                the results for the following parameters:

            <ul>
                <li>\(g = 0\) (we want to show the effects of oscillation for now)</li>
                <li>\(\omega^2 = 100\)</li>
                <li>\(\Gamma = 0.5\)</li>
                <li>\(\Lambda = 5\) </li>
                <li>\(\omega_d = 1\)</li>
            </ul>
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>THERE! THERE!</b> Do you see that? It is the <b>TRANSVERSE WAVES</b> &#x1f973;! Alright alright, how
                about
                some gravity?
                Let us make
            <ul>
                <li>\(g=9.81\)</li>
                <li>\(\omega^2 = 10000\) (otherwise gravity wins over the spring forces)</li>
                <li>\(\Gamma = 1\) (for the same reason as above, and since gravity will increase the velocity by a lot
                    quickly, so we need to <em>damp it down</em>)</li>
            </ul>

            Let us also start with \(\Lambda = 0\) to let gravity do its work in the beginning. Thereafter, we will make
            \(\Lambda = 500\). We will also start with \(\omega_d = 1\) then increment it by 1 thrice and notice
            some interesting wave-pattern emerging.
            </p>

                Oh! The wave are <em>standing</em> still in their place rather than propagate forward, and every time we
                increment the integer values of the frequency the number of <em>peaks</em> (called antinodes) seem to
                increase by one... interesting &#x1F914;. Anyway, whew! Our mathematical model worked pretty
                well! So as the famous (maybe not so famous) saying goes:

            For the next time, we will look into longitudinal waves by generalising our driving force to be in any of
            the
            \(\hat{x}, \hat{y}\) or \(\hat{z}\) direction.

                Well well well, there has been a slight turn of events. I presented my idea and prototypes to the course
                examiner, and the feedback I got was that in order to get a high grade (hopefully A) I must add a focus
                on a research-based topic. I am aiming for a high grade and have thus changed my plans slightly. I
                decided to drop the longitudinal wave visualisation part of the project and focus only on transverse
                waves. Instead, I will compare the model we discussed in the previous update, which I will henceforth
                call the <em>Force Based Dynamics</em> model abbreviated as <abbr
                    title="Force Based Dynamics">FBD</abbr>, with a model called Position Based Dynamics shorted to
                <abbr title="Position Based Dynamics">PBD</abbr>. This model will be based on the paper <em><a
                        href="https://matthias-research.github.io/pages/publications/posBasedDyn.pdf">Position Based
                        Dynamics</a></em> by Müller, M. et al. with some inspiration from the paper <em><a
                        href="http://graphics.berkeley.edu/papers/Liu-FSM-2013-11/Liu-FSM-2013-11.pdf">Fast Simulation
                        of Mass-Spring Systems</a></em> by Liu, T. et al. regarding damping. So in this update I will
                present how PBD will be implemented in this project and show some results using the same context of
                the videos in the previous update. So let us get started!
            </p>

            <p>
                PBD uses two components: vertices and constraints. Without going deep into mathematics here, a vertex is
                like a body; it has a position \(X\), a velocity \(\dot{X}\), and mass \(m\), whilst a constraint is
                simple a rule we apply on the positions of a number of vertices. In our case the constraints will only
                be applied to pairs of vertices, and these constraints will be very similar to Hookean spring forces.
                They have the form \(C(X_i, X_j) = \kappa(\lVert X_i - X_j\rVert - R\)), where \(R\) is the <em>rest
                    length</em> of the spring, and \(\kappa \in [0, 1]\) is a <em>spring stiffness</em>-like factor. In
                every step in the simulation we estimate the next position of the vertices, then apply the constraints
                to optimise the estimations. The way we change these estimations uses some multivariable calculus, but
                the final form of the change be seen in step 4 of the algorithm below. The optimised position
                estimations become the vertices' new positions. In summary here is the steps of the algorithm in very
                high language: after we initialise the \(n\) vertices, we do the following at each step in the
                simulation:
            <ol>
                <li>Update the velocities \(\dot{X}_i\) of vertices \(i=1,2,\ldots,n\) using external forces
                    (gravitational and driving forces)</li>
                <li>Damp the velocities using \(\dot{X}_i \gets \alpha \dot{X}_i\) for some \(\alpha \in [0, 1]\)</li>
                <li>Estimate the positions as \(\tilde{X}_i = X_i + \Delta t \dot{X}_i\)</li>
                <li>For vertices \(j\) and \(j+1\) add \(\Delta \tilde{X}_j = -\frac{\kappa}{2}C(\tilde{X}_j,
                    \tilde{X}_{j+1})\frac{\tilde{X}_j - \tilde{X}_{j+1}}{\lVert\tilde{X}_j - \tilde{X}_{j+1}\rVert}\) to
                    \(\tilde{X}_j\) and \(\Delta \tilde{X}_{j+1} = -\Delta \tilde{X}_j\) to \(\tilde{X}_{j+1}\), for \(j
                    = 1,2,\ldots,n-1\)</li>
                <li>Update the vertices thusly: \(\dot{X}_i \gets (\tilde{X}_i - X_i)/\Delta t\) and \(X_i \gets
                    \tilde{X_i}\)</li>
            </ol>

            If we are using immovable walls, then we treat them as vertices in step 4 but don't update their positions
            in step 5. You may have noticed that positions are the main focus of this algorithm. Forces are only used if
            they are external and are solely used to update the velocity. The rest of the algorithm only uses the
            positions to update the velocities and position forward in time. You may have also noticed that even though
            vertices by definition use mass, our algorithm does not. This is due to the fact that the if we
            assume all the masses are the same and, just like previously, the masses simply cancel out giving us a
            massless algorithm. Pretty cool!</p>

            <p>
                Alright now, how does this look like in Unity? First let us clean things up. We will separate the FBD
                code into its own class, and create a new class for the PBD. In the <abbr
                    title="Coupled Spring-Mass System">CSMS</abbr> let us make it possible to choose between FBD and PBD
                in order to make our comparison later. Now let us see the results! First up is the simulation of
                transverse waves without gravity.
            </p>

            <p>
                It seems to work pretty well! It is a bit janky sometimes but overall it is very realistic! Let us add
                some gravity (add more spring stiffness, and driving force amplitude for the same reason as before).
                Here is what that looks like
            </p>

            </figure>

            <p>
                Yeah... the start was a bit <em>interesting</em> but overall the simulation looked very realistic!
                Things are looking good for the PBD model! Awesome &#x1F60E;!
            </p>

            <p>
                In the next update, I will try to compare the two models and perhaps optimise the models further if
                possible. See you later!

            <h3>Update 3 - Measure Twice... Cut Twice &#x1F62C;</h3>
            <h6>9th of March 2024</h6>
            <p>
                Hello again! Long time no see! I have been working on the report quite a lot recently and also gathered
                some data to compare the <abbr title="Force-Based Dynamics">FBD</abbr> and <abbr
                    title="Position-Based Dynamics">PBD</abbr> models. I have also noticed a small mistake in my
                Runge-Kutta 4 iteration which significantly changed the motion of the <abbr
                    title="Coupled Spring-Mass System">CSMS</abbr> you saw in the videos from the previous updates.
            </p>

            <p>
                Let me start by describing the, very silly &#x1F605;, mistake. In the FBD, every iteration one should
                use the positions and velocities from the previous step to calculate the new positions and
                velocities then after the calculations are done the positions and velocities are updated. See the code
                below for the correct way to do this.
            </p>

            <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
for b in bodies {
    do Runge-Kutta 4 step for b
    store new position and velocity in new_p, new_v
}
for b in bodies {
    b.position = new_p
    b.velocity = new_v
}
            </code>

            <p>
                Instead of updating at the end, I updated the positions and velocity immediately after calculation
                like so
            </p>

            <code style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
for b in bodies {
    do Runge-Kutta 4 step for b
    store new position and velocity in new_p, new_v
    b.position = new_p
    b.velocity = new_v
}
            </code>

            <p>
                And since the next body uses the previous body for spring calculation the position of the previous body
                have already changed and the forces become unbalanced creating a more 'ropey' effect. The new and more
                correct FBD simulations look like this now.
            </p>

            </figure>
            <p>
                Very less ropey and more stiff-springy, especially in the gravity version where I increased the
                \(\omega^2\) to avoid the spring breaking.
            </p>

            <p>
                Now, on to do some comparisons. I did a brief study of the motion of both models in the report but I
                will not do that here because well, you can see the motion in the videos. I will instead show a small
                performance analysis I did. I ran each models with 50, 100, 250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500, 2000, and 3000
                bodies/vertices then measured the time it took to call the step method. This was done classically by
                storing the time before the call then measuring the difference after the call finished. The results are
                in the plot below.
            </p>

            <figure class="center bordered">
                <img src="Blog/Update3/model_iteration_time.png"

                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            <p>
                As you can see, PBD is a lot faster because it does one 'motion calculation' per step whereas the FBD
                with Runge-Kutta 4 does four. Therefore we see that the time differs by around a factor of four.
            </p>

            <p>
                That is it for today. I will probably do another update with the final demonstration and some conclusive
                thoughts. Until next time &#x1F44B;!

            <h3>Update 4 - The Final Update</h3>
            <h6>12th of March 2024</h6>

            <p>Greetings! This is the final update and for that I have recorded a small demonstration showing everything
                (I hope)
                about the two models. Enjoy!</p>

            <p>(If you are wondering the music is <em>Danse Macabre</em> by Camille Saint-Saëns)</p>

            <p>
                The models seemed to work very well! Did you also see how the Euler Forward integrator makes everything
                go CRAZY? Yeah, that is why Runge-Kutta 4 is better in this situation.
            </p>

            <p>
                Regarding the project, it was honestly amazing! I learned a lot about physics and computer graphics. I
                have some regrets regarding the process but I learned a lot about planning and researching which will
                definitely come to use later in life! In summary, my advice is to start focusing on a topic early on
                rather than try to learn everything about a topic, especially when the timeframe of the project is very
                limited. It will reduce the risk of burnout!
            </p>

            <p>
                Finally, I would like to thank the course-responsible and teaching assistants of DD1354 for the numerous
                feedback opportunities they provided! As a last remark, I will list some references which I found 
                interesting regarding <abbr title="Position-Based Dynamics">PBD</abbr> and similar, since that model was
                especially useful in computer graphics.
