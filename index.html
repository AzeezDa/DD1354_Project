            <h3>Session 1 - In Unity There Is Strength</h3>
            <h6>25th of February 2022</h6>

            Welcome to my project blog in the DD1354 Models and Simulation course. My name is Azeez Daoud and I am here
            to invite you to venture with me in world of <b>WAVES!</b>. It is a world full of differential equations,
            numerical analysis, and a whole lot of springs and masses. Together we will build a assemble a system of
            coupled springs and masses, shake the living out of it to produce two types of waves: transverse and
            longitudinal waves. The former propagates through the medium by displacing it perpendicularly in the
            direction of its motion. The latter displaces the medium in the direction of motion. This might seem quite
            abstract, so here is an image showing the two types:

                    alt="An image of transverse and longitudinal waves moving through a spring">
                <figcaption>
                    Image from
                    <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/08/CNX_UPhysics_16_01_GirlWave.png"
                        target="_blank">wikimedia.org</a>
                </figcaption>
            </figure>

            How do we visualise that? Well, we need 3 ingredients:
            <ol>
                <li>Physics</li>
                <li>Numerical Analysis</li>
                <li>Somewhere to do the simulation</li>
            </ol> 

            Let us focus on the third point first by choosing a tool to do our simulation. I have decided to use <a href="https://unity.com/">The Unity Game Engine</a>, because it is easy to use and gives very good results with as little of the nitty-gritty of setting up the code for graphical display.
